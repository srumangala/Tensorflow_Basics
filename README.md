# Tensorflow_Basics
This repository contains a small tensorflow introduction. It has the following modules coded with tensorflow.

1. Basic Tensorflow
2. Few core machine learning algorithms
3. Neural Networks basics
4. Computer Vision basics
5. RNN basics
6. Reinforcement learning basics

This is just a repo with the stuff I am learning about tensorflow.

All of this is learnt from the youtube course : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk
